<h2> <a name="TC"> What's in the Book </a> </h2>

<p> This book is an introduction to computational algebraic geometry
and commutative algebra at the undergraduate level.  It discusses
systems of polynomial equations ("ideals"), their solutions
("varieties"), and how these objects can be manipulated
("algorithms").  </p>

<p> In 2016, <i>
Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms</i> was awarded the <a href="http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201604/rnoti-p417.pdf"> Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition</a> by the American Mathematical Society.  The article <a href="http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201606/rnoti-p626.pdf"> <i>The Story of Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms</i></a> tells how the book came to be written.

<h2> <a name="CP"> Computer Packages </a> </h2>

<p> On pages 522 and 524 of the third edition (= pages 510 and 512 of
the second edition), Appendix C mentions computer packages for
Maple and Mathematica.  The packages were written for teaching
purposes and tend to be very slow.  Thus you can use them only on very
simple problems.  
</p>

<p> For Releases 2, 3 and 4 of Maple V, the following versions of the
Maple package are available: 
<ul>
<li> <a href="iva/grobnerR2.sub"> <b> Maple Package for Release 2 of
Maple V</b></a>
<li> <a href="iva/grobnerR3.sub"> <b> Maple Package for Release 3 of
Maple V</b></a> <br> 
<li> <a href="iva/grobnerR4.sub"> <b> Maple Package for Release 4 of
Maple V</b></a>
</ul>
The main commands in the Maple package are <b>div_alg</b>, which computes
quotients and remainders in the division algorithm, and <b>mxgb</b>,
which computes a Gr&ouml;bner basis together with a matrix showing how
to express the Gr&ouml;bner basis in terms of the original basis.
</p>

<p> For Release 5 of Maple V, an expanded version of the Maple package
is available.  This version includes commands for computing
Gr&ouml;bner bases which give intermediate steps as well as tutorial
and reference worksheets.  The files involved are:
<ul>
<li> <a href="iva/gbr5.mpl"> <b> Maple Package for Release 5 of Maple
V </b></a>
<li> <a href="iva/gbr5.mws"> <b> Tutorial Worksheet for the Maple Package
</b></a>
<li> <a href="iva/gbr5hlp.mws"> <b> Reference Worksheet for the Maple
Package </b></a>
</ul>
The Maple package can be used without either of the worksheets.  The
tutorial and reference worksheets, on the other hand, require that you
also download the package.  The tutorial worksheet discusses the
various commands in the package and gives examples of how they work,
while the reference worksheet gives the precise syntax of each command
in the package.  
</p>

<p> <b> WARNING:</b> The IVA Maple package for Release 5 of Maple V is
<b>incompatible</b> with Maple 6 and Maple 7.  For Maple 6 and 7, you
should download the following files:
<ul>
<li> <a href="iva/gbm6.mpl"> <b> Maple Package for Maple 6 and 7
</b></a>
<li> <a href="iva/gbm6.mws"> <b> Tutorial Worksheet for the Maple Package
</b></a>
<li> <a href="iva/gbm6hlp.mws"> <b> Reference Worksheet for the Maple
Package </b></a>
</ul>
As far as we know, these work with more recent releases of Maple,
including Maple 9 and 10.
</p>

<p> For Mathematica, the following versions of the Mathematica package
are available:
<ul>
<li> <a href="iva/groebner40.m"><b> Mathematica Package for Mathematica
4</b></a> <br> 
<li> <a href="iva/groebner40.nb"><b> Mathematica Notebook for Mathematica
4</b></a> <br> 
<li> <a href="iva/groebner50.m"><b> Mathematica Package for Mathematica
5</b></a> <br> 
<li> <a href="iva/groebner50.nb"><b> Mathematica Notebook for Mathematica
5</b></a> <br>
<li> <a href="iva/groebner60.m"><b> Mathematica Package for Mathematica
6</b></a> <br> 
<li> <a href="iva/groebner60.nb"><b> Mathematica Notebook for Mathematica
6</b></a> <br> 
</ul>
<b> WARNING:</b> The Mathematica 5 versions of the Package and Notebook
<i> do not </i> work with Mathematica 6. 
</p>

<p>
When using these Mathematica packages and notebooks, the following
should be kept in mind:
<ul>
<li> The Mathematica package is <i> not </i> a notebook.  It needs to
be loaded using &lt;&lt;.  
<li> The Mathematica notebook is a tutorial explaining how to use the
package.  In order to use the tutorial, you must also download the
package.  The tutorial is <b>not</b> compatible with the 2.0 version
of the package.  
<li> The RadicalQ command in the package does not work in the 2.0
version.  
<li> The 3.0 and 4.0 versions of the package are faster than the 2.0
version (and RadicalQ works).  The 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 versions can also use
matrix and elimination orders and include several commands for
zero-dimensional ideals not present in the 2.0 version.
</ul>

<p>
In general, if you have difficulties with either of the packages or
suggestions for improvements, please let us know!  (Thanks to David
Vella and his students at Skidmore for the information that the 4.0
version of the package doesn't work with Mathematica 5.0.  They also
suggested the solution implemented in the 5.0 version of the package.)

<h2> <a name="TE"> Typographical Errors </a></h2>

<h3>Fifth Edition</h3>

<p> The fifth edition was originally published August 8th, 2025.

<h3>Fourth Edition</h3>

<p> The fourth edition was originally published in 2015. A corrected 
publication appeared in 2018.  
<ul>
<li> Typos known as of August 2016 are available in <a
href="iva/4ed.pdf"> pdf </a>. These typos were corrected in the 2018 
publication.
<li> Typos in the 2018 corrected publication are available in <a href="iva/4ed.corr2024.pdf"> pdf </a>.  These typos also appear in the version published in 2015.
</ul>
You can determine which version of the fourth edition you have by looking 
for "corrected publication 2018" on the copyright page.

<h3> Third Edition</h3>

<p> Lists of typographical errors are available for the third
edition. There are two lists, depending on which printing you have. Because of the fourth edition, the typo list for the third edition is no longer being updated. </p>

<h2> <a name="SE">Solutions to Selected Exercises </a></h2>

<p> A complete solutions manual for <i>Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms</i> has been written up by David Cox and Ying Li of St. Francis University. </p>  

<!--<p> Solutions to various exercises from the first four chapters have
been written up by Fred Woodward under the direction of Michael Singer
of North Carolina State University.  We are grateful to Fred and
Michael for allowing us to use their solutions.  </p>

<p> Solutions to selected exercises from the whole book have been
written up by Hyeyoun Chung for a seminar supervised by Steven Kleiman
of MIT.  We are grateful to Hyeyoun and Steve for allowing us to use
their solutions.  </p>-->

<p> The solutions are not posted here because having open access to the solutions would diminish the value of the text.  <i>Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms</i> is a book where you learn by doing.  If you are
teaching from <i>Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms</i> or are studying
the book on your own, you may obtain a pdf copy of the solutions by
sending email to <a
href="mailto:donalboshea@gmail.com">donalboshea@gmail.com</a>.  <!--When
requesting a copy, please let us know whether you would prefer the
solutions sent in a LaTeX file, a postscript
file, or a pdf file.  Hardcopy is also available if for some reason
the electronic versions aren't suitable.-->

<h2> <a name="CAP">Computer Algebra Programs </a></h2>


<p> The book describes the computer algebra systems
<i>Maple</i>, <i>Mathematica</i> and <i>Sage</i> in some detail. <i>Maple</i> and <i>Mathematica</i> are commercial products, while  <a
href="http://www.sagemath.org"><i>Sage</i></a> is freely available. at
<ul>
<li> <b> <a
href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a></b>
</ul>
In addition, here are some other computer algebra programs which can do
Gr&ouml;bner basis calculations:
<ul>
<li> <b><a href = "https://Macaulay2.com"> Macaulay2</a></b>
<li> <b><a href = "http://cocoa.dima.unige.it">CoCoA</a></b>
<li> <b> <a
href="http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/">Magma</a></b> 
<li> <b> <a
href="http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/">Singular</a></b> 
</ul>
Of these, all are free except for Magma. </p>

<h2> <a name="2ed"> Remarks on Earlier Editions of IVA</h2>

<ul>
<li> Appendix C of first edition of IVA describes the
  obsolete <b>grobner package</b> for Maple, 
  while subsequent editions describe the 
<b>Groebner package</b> now used in Maple. 
<li> In the 5th printing of the second edition of IVA, a production
error caused plus signs to appear as minus signs on many pages.  Hence
the 5th printing of the second edition is defective.  
<li> The first three editions of IVA mention the existence of computer
  packages for Maple and Mathematica.  These packages are no longer
  supported and are not available.
<li>The earlier practice of paying $1 US for each new typographical
  error has been discontinued, though we are always
  grateful when 
  readers notify the authors about errors they find in the book.  
</ul>
