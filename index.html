<h2> <a name="TC"> What's in the Book </a> </h2>

<p> This book is an introduction to computational algebraic geometry
and commutative algebra at the undergraduate level.  It discusses
systems of polynomial equations ("ideals"), their solutions
("varieties"), and how these objects can be manipulated
("algorithms").  </p>

<p> In 2016, <i>
Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms</i> was awarded the <a href="http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201604/rnoti-p417.pdf"> Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition</a> by the American Mathematical Society.  The article <a href="http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201606/rnoti-p626.pdf"> <i>The Story of Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms</i></a> tells how the book came to be written.

<h2> <a name="TE"> Typographical Errors </a></h2>

<h3>Fifth Edition</h3>

<p> The fifth edition was originally published August 8th, 2025.

<h3>Fourth Edition</h3>

<p> The fourth edition was originally published in 2015. A corrected 
publication appeared in 2018.  
<ul>
<li> Typos known as of August 2016 are available in <a
href="iva/4ed.pdf"> pdf </a>. These typos were corrected in the 2018 
publication.
<li> Typos in the 2018 corrected publication are available in <a href="iva/4ed.corr2024.pdf"> pdf </a>.  These typos also appear in the version published in 2015.
</ul>
You can determine which version of the fourth edition you have by looking 
for "corrected publication 2018" on the copyright page.

<h3> Third Edition</h3>

<p> Lists of typographical errors are available for the third
edition. There are two lists, depending on which printing you have. Because of the fourth edition, the typo list for the third edition is no longer being updated. </p>

<ul>
<li> Typos in the first printing corrected in the second printing: <a
href="iva/3ed1.pdf"> pdf </a> or <a
href="iva/3ed1.ps"> postscript </a>.
<li> Typos present in the first and second printings: <a
href="iva/3ed2.pdf"> pdf </a> or <a
href="iva/3ed2.ps"> postscript </a>.</ul>

<p> To find out which printing you have, check the second line from
the bottom on the copyright page; the last digit displayed is the
printing number.  If you have the first printing, you will need to
download both lists; if you have the second printing, you only need
the second.</p>

<h2> <a name="SE">Solutions to Selected Exercises </a></h2>

<p> A complete solutions manual for <i>Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms</i> has been written up by David Cox and Ying Li of St. Francis University. </p>  

<!--<p> Solutions to various exercises from the first four chapters have
been written up by Fred Woodward under the direction of Michael Singer
of North Carolina State University.  We are grateful to Fred and
Michael for allowing us to use their solutions.  </p>

<p> Solutions to selected exercises from the whole book have been
written up by Hyeyoun Chung for a seminar supervised by Steven Kleiman
of MIT.  We are grateful to Hyeyoun and Steve for allowing us to use
their solutions.  </p>-->

<p> The solutions are not posted here because having open access to the solutions would diminish the value of the text.  <i>Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms</i> is a book where you learn by doing.  If you are
teaching from <i>Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms</i> or are studying
the book on your own, you may obtain a pdf copy of the solutions by
sending email to <a
href="mailto:donalboshea@gmail.com">donalboshea@gmail.com</a>.  <!--When
requesting a copy, please let us know whether you would prefer the
solutions sent in a LaTeX file, a postscript
file, or a pdf file.  Hardcopy is also available if for some reason
the electronic versions aren't suitable.-->

<h2> <a name="CAP">Computer Algebra Programs </a></h2>


<p> The book describes the computer algebra systems
<i>Maple</i>, <i>Mathematica</i> and <i>Sage</i> in some detail. <i>Maple</i> and <i>Mathematica</i> are commercial products, while  <a
href="http://www.sagemath.org"><i>Sage</i></a> is freely available. at
<ul>
<li> <b> <a
href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a></b>
</ul>
In addition, here are some other computer algebra programs which can do
Gr&ouml;bner basis calculations:
<ul>
<li> <b><a href = "https://Macaulay2.com"> Macaulay2</a></b>
<li> <b><a href = "http://cocoa.dima.unige.it">CoCoA</a></b>
<li> <b> <a
href="http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/">Magma</a></b> 
<li> <b> <a
href="http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/">Singular</a></b> 
</ul>
Of these, all are free except for Magma. </p>

<h2> <a name="2ed"> Remarks on Earlier Editions of IVA</h2>

<ul>
<li> Appendix C of first edition of IVA describes the
  obsolete <b>grobner package</b> for Maple, 
  while subsequent editions describe the 
<b>Groebner package</b> now used in Maple. 
<li> In the 5th printing of the second edition of IVA, a production
error caused plus signs to appear as minus signs on many pages.  Hence
the 5th printing of the second edition is defective.  
<li> The first three editions of IVA mention the existence of computer
  packages for Maple and Mathematica.  These packages are no longer
  supported and are not available.
<li>The earlier practice of paying $1 US for each new typographical
  error has been discontinued, though we are always
  grateful when 
  readers notify the authors about errors they find in the book.  
</ul>

<h2> <a name="UAG"> Using Algebraic Geometry </a></h2>

<p> Click <a href="uag.html"> here</a> for the web page for our
book <i>Using Algebraic Geometry</i>.  This book is an
introduction to Gr&ouml;bner bases and resultants, which are two of
the main tools used in computational algebraic geometry and
commutative algebra.  It also discusses local methods and syzygies,
and gives applications to integer programming, polynomial splines and
algebraic coding theory.  The second edition was published by
Springer in the summer of 2005.  It is available in both
hardcover and paperback.
